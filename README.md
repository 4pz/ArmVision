# ArmVision

ArmVision is an Object Detection program utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify firearms in real time video using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm aiming to reduce casualties caused by gun violence as well as put a stop to them before they occur.

## Usage

To release this open source, I very briefly formatted what I had in my Google Colab to Python format. [PLEASE USE THE GOOGLE COLAB FILE IF YOU PLAN ON USING THIS! (FULLWORKING.ipynb)](https://github.com/Simple2006/ArmVision/blob/main/FULLWORKING.ipynb). Just import the dataset provided or use your own dataset in order to use with Google Colab.

## General Information

ArmVision was created by me, a 14-year old high schooler at Lynbrook High School in December. I continued Development through March and have completed development. There is still a lot of work left to do in order to refine the detection for longer distances.

## Future Plans

Although development is currently completed, I plan on working on it if time permits in the future. I would like to have this used in security cameras at schools, offices, and other places
